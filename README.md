# CALCULATOR
Create your own Python Calculator App using Python and tkinter.

This is a Python code for a simple calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) created using the Tkinter module. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations, square and square root functions, and the ability to clear the current expression.

The calculator's GUI is created using a window with a fixed size of 375x667 pixels. It consists of two main parts: a display frame at the top and a buttons frame at the bottom. The display frame contains two labels that display the current expression and the total expression, respectively. The buttons frame contains a grid of buttons for digits, arithmetic operations, and special functions.

The calculator class has several methods for creating and configuring the GUI components, as well as for handling user input and performing calculations. The bind_keys() method binds keyboard keys to specific calculator functions, allowing the user to use the keyboard in addition to the GUI.

Overall, this code provides a good starting point for building a simple calculator with a GUI in Python using Tkinter. It can be further modified and expanded upon to add more advanced functionality and improve the user experience.
